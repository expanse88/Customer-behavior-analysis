 

# 📊 Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python, PostgreSQL, and Power BI. It covers data exploration, cleaning, SQL analysis, and dashboard development to extract meaningful insights from a structured dataset.

The goal is to showcase practical data analytics skills including:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* SQL querying on a PostgreSQL database
* Business insight generation
* Interactive dashboard creation

---

## Dataset

The dataset is stored and processed using Python. It contains structured records suitable for analytical querying and visualization.

### Key steps performed:

* Loaded dataset using Python data libraries
* Handled missing values and inconsistencies
* Standardized formats and data types
* Prepared cleaned dataset for database import

---

## Tech Stack

* **Python** — data processing and EDA
* **Pandas** — analysis and visualization
* **PostgreSQL** — data storage and SQL analysis
* **Power BI** — interactive dashboard and reporting

---

## Project Workflow

1. Load dataset in Python
2. Perform exploratory data analysis
3. Clean and preprocess data
4. Import processed data into PostgreSQL
5. Run SQL queries to generate insights
6. Build Power BI dashboard for visualization

---

## How to Run

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/expanse88/Customer-behavior-analysis.git
 cd Customer-behavior-analysis
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run Data Processing

Execute the Python scripts or notebook to:

* Load the dataset
* Perform EDA
* Clean and transform data
* Export data for database import

### 4. Load Data into PostgreSQL
